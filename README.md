# FastPath_MP

## Description
This repository stores the source code of FastPath_MP, an FPGA-based multi-path architecture 
for direct access from FPGA to NVMe SSD.
In particular it includes three modules:
- The FastPath_MP FPGA architecture implemented in `Bluespec`.
- The `libfnvme` library that implements the C-based API that applications can utilize to communicate with FastPath_MP.
- The modified NVMe driver in the Linux kernel (`linux-4.4-zynq`) for the Xilinx Zynq 7000 SoC.
