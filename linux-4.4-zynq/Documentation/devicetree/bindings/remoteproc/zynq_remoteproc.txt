Xilinx ARM Cortex A9-A9 remoteproc driver
==========================================

Zynq family of devices can use one A9 processor to help with various
low power / real time tasks.

This driver requires specific Zynq hardware design.

Zynq RemoteProc Device Node:
=================================
A zynq_remoteproc device node is used to represent the 2nd A9 instance
within Zynq SoC.

Required properties:
--------------------
 - compatible : should be "xlnx,zynq_remoteproc"
 - reg : address and length of the register set for the device
         which defines the memory for the firmware and the shared memory
 - firmware: default firmware name
 - vring0: soft interrupt for kicking from firmware
 - vring1: soft interrupt for kicking from Linux kernel

Optional properties:
--------------------
 - firmware : default firmware image name which can be loaded by remoteproc
              framework - this value can be override by "firmware" module
              parameter

Example:
--------
	zynq_remoteproc@0 {
		compatible = "xlnx,zynq_remoteproc";
		reg = < 0x00000000 0x10000000 >;
		firmware = "firmware";
		vring0 = <15>;
		vring1 = <14>;
	};
