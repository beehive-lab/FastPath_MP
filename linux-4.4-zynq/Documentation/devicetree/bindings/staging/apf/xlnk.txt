* Xilinx APF xlnk driver

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "xlnx,xlnk"
- clock-names: List of clock names
- clocks: List of clock sources corresponding to the clock names

The number of elements on the clock-names and clocks lists should be the same.
If there are no controllable clocks, the xlnk node should be omitted from the
devicetree.

Example:
	xlnk {
		compatible = "xlnx,xlnk-1.0";
		clock-names = "clk166", "clk150", "clk100", "clk200";
		clocks = <&clkc 15>, <&clkc 16>, <&clkc 17>, <&clkc 18>;
	};
