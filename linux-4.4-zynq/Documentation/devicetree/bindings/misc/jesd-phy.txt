* Xilinx JESD204B Phy

Description:
The LogiCOREâ„¢ IP JESD204 PHY core implements a JESD204B Physical interface supporting
line rates between 1.0 and 12.5 Gb/s on 1 to 12 lanes using GTX, GTH, or GTP transceivers.

Required properties:
- compatible = "xlnx,jesd204-phy-2.0"
- reg = Should contain JESD204B phy registers location and length
- xlnx,pll-selection = The PLL selection 3 for QPLL and 1 For CPLL
- xlnx,lanes = No of Lanes
- xlnx,gt-refclk-freq = Reference frequency in Hz
- clocks = The phandle to the clock tree

Example:
++++++++
	jesd204_phycores:phy@41e10000 {
		compatible = "xlnx,jesd204-phy-2.0";
		reg = <0x41e10000 0x10000>;
		xlnx,gt-refclk-freq = "156250000";
		xlnx,lanes = <0x1>;
		xlnx,pll-selection = <0x3>;
		clocks = <&si570>;
	};
